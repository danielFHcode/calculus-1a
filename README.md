# Calculus 1A @ Tel Aviv University, First Semester of 2025-2026

These are the lecture notes for this course, written in the [Typst](https://typst.app/) typesetting language.
[YOU CAN FIND THE LECTURE NOTES IN PDF FORM HERE](https://github.com/danielFHcode/calculus-1a/releases/latest).

I am also trying to formalize the course using the the [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html) proof language - why? Good question. As part of this endeavor I have proved several very important theorems, such as [`0 = -0`](https://github.com/danielFHcode/calculus-1a/blob/213dae4221e62440cc22cf98315851e6ea6cb6d1/2025-10-26.agda#L312), and [`-(-x) = x`](https://github.com/danielFHcode/calculus-1a/blob/213dae4221e62440cc22cf98315851e6ea6cb6d1/2025-10-26.agda#L198). Any holes in the proofs are either things not proven during the lectures or things I couldn't be bothered to prove myself (pull requests are welcome btw).
